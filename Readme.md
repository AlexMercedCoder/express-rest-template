## USING THIS TEMPLATE:

- Make sure to run npm install

- Environmental variables defined in env.yaml, so create a env.yaml that looks like this...

```yaml
development:
  PORT: 4000
  SECRET: "production"

production:
  PORT: 3000
  SECRET: "development"
```

- auth.js has most of the auth middleware logic built out, just create a verify user function based on your particular database setup.
